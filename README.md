# Calculator - The Odin Project
This is the last project in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

At this point, I should have a solid basic knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, this project is a demonstration of that. It consists in a functional calculator available as a webpage.
